# About this application
Our app helps you explore countries and continents easily. You can check out different continents<br>
and see details about countries like flags, capitals, and populations. It gets data from the REST<br>
Countries API, so you'll always get accurate info. Plus, you can search for countries easily. If<br>
you're not connected to the internet or there's a problem with the server, the app handles it. It's<br>
made with Flutter and GetX, so it works smoothly on any device.<br>
