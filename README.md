# About this application
Our app helps you explore countries and continents easily. You can check out different continents
and see details about countries like flags, capitals, and populations. It gets data from the REST
Countries API, so you'll always get accurate info. Plus, you can search for countries easily. If
you're not connected to the internet or there's a problem with the server, the app handles it. It's
made with Flutter and GetX, so it works smoothly on any device.
